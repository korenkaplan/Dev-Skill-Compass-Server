## ‚ùì How It Works?

### ‚úÖ Data Reliability

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you avoid collecting data from the same listings on different sites?</h4></summary>
  
  We gather job listings from aggregator sites that collect postings from various sources. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we also check individual job sites directly. If a listing is already collected from another source, we skip it to avoid duplicates.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you avoid collecting the same listing every day?</h4></summary>
  
  Our system scans job listings every 24 hours, focusing on posts from the past day. This method ensures we don't collect the same listing on different days.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you handle duplication of listings within the same list?</h4></summary>
  
  We compare company names, locations, and job titles to identify and skip duplicate listings during our scanning process.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you filter out non-relevant listings?</h4></summary>
  
  We analyze job titles to ensure they match the desired role. For example, we filter out listings like "Full-stack Developer" in a search for "Backend Developer."
</details>


### üîé Text Analysis and Data Aggregation

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you extract relevant words from a text?</h4></summary>
  
  We use a dataset of technological keywords to identify and extract relevant terms from job descriptions.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you handle different spellings and synonyms of the same technology?</h4></summary>
  
  We group synonyms and different spellings, like [node.js, node, nodeJs], into a single category during our data aggregation process.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you count the appearance of tech keywords in a single job description?</h4></summary>
  
  We use a Set data structure to count each technology's appearance uniquely, regardless of how many times it appears in the text.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4>How do you count the same keyword for different roles?</h4></summary>
  
  We maintain separate counts of each technology for each role. When scanning job listings, we specify the role related to those postings, ensuring the counts are associated with the correct role.
</details>
